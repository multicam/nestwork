The Patino Palace, built in the 50's, inspired by the Portuguese architecture of the 18th century, is the result of the great passion of the Bolivian billionaire, Antenor Patino, for Portugal, in particular for Estoril. Here, he ordered the construction of his holiday home, occupying three hectares of the fifty that make up the Condominium, therefore choosing the highest point of the Farm, with a superb sea view, surrounded by the lush green of the trees that characterize it. The Palace offers unique architectural elements, such as a sumptuous Joanina-inspired library, wooden ceilings, walls decorated with frescoes, tiles dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.

With a private gross area of 3,350 square meters, comprising three floors, we find an imposing entrance hall with double height on the main floor, living room, dining room and library, all with direct access to the Terrace, overlooking the majestic gardens. Still on this floor, there are two en-suite bedrooms, an office and a guest toilet. The upper floor has twelve en-suite bedrooms and access to the service area, a separate wing of the Palace where these are located, several storage rooms, kitchen, pantry and technical areas. Downstairs, there is the cinema room, still with the original projectors from the 60s, a Spa with sauna, a Steam room and a massage room. There is also a service Apartment located outside the Palace. A Bowling Pavilion, a romantic tea room and support facilities for the pool area are also integral parts of the Palace.
