                    Nestlove is the home to your dreams. We buy luxury properties in aspirational destinations
                    throughout Australia and then create specific purpose Trusts for co-ownership for 5 to 8 investors.
                    In doing so we utilize our skills for property acquisition, management and styling while owners get
                    a tax effective investment, capital growth and magnificent holiday destinations. Discover a better
                    way to own property in high growth areas.

                    Our target areas for property acquisition are prestige holiday locations around Australia. We create
                    specific purpose Trusts for each home with 5 or 6 shares. We then vet and fund our co-owners
                    (NestLovers) into each shareholding. NestLovers have the advantage of diversifying their property
                    holdings into the most sought after areas in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can buy 1 or all the shares in the
                    property and if circumstances change and you want to sell your shareholding it can be re-offered
                    onto
                    the NestLove platform.
